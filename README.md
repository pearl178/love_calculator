# love_calculator

This little project is for younger self who was in middle school and whose only problem in life is wondering whether her crush liked her back or not ðŸ‘§)

This is a magical calculator that tests the compatibility between two people (if only you believe itðŸ˜‰).

All you have to do is enter the names of the two people whom your want to test the compatibility and the outcome would tell the result.
On how this calculator works: 
Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs. 
Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs. 
Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number. 
Then this would be the compatibility score.
You would receive some commenting message with the score (or notðŸ˜‰).
